// ── Seams no bus interface serves ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This module serves seven of the host's nine seams. Six cross the bus: the
// embedder and the chat model have host interfaces of their own, `composio_host`
// has one too (see `crate::composio`), and the event sink, the error reporter
// and spaCy share `BusRuntimeHost` above. The seventh, `config_loader`, is
// answered locally from the `ModuleConfig` this module was handed, for the
// reason its own module docs give: proxying it would ask the host to re-read a
// config the module already has, and the interesting case is the one where the
// two answers disagree.
//
// The two below are what is left, and both were quiet on every path. With
// nothing installed, `scheduler_gate::current_policy()` reads `Normal` and
// `wait_for_capacity()` returns instantly — background LLM work runs flat out no
// matter what the user asked for — and `shutdown::register` drops the ingest
// queue's lock-release hook behind a `log::debug!`. That is precisely the
// outcome the host's own `install_memory_host_seams` comment says the seams
// exist to prevent: a sync run that looks empty rather than broken. Silence is
// the bug; these stubs are the fix.
//
// # Why stubs and not bus proxies
//
// Not a surface-budget choice — the trait shapes rule a proxy out.
// `SchedulerGate::current_policy` is sync and a bus call is not; `resume_notify`
// hands back a `tokio::sync::Notify`, a runtime primitive with no wire form; and
// `ShutdownHost::register` takes a Rust closure, which cannot be serialised at
// all. Mirroring the policy locally would need a signal this module does not
// declare (`signals = []`), a host half this crate does not own, and a cache
// that is wrong between ticks.
//
// # Why not synthesise a policy from the module's own config
//
// `ModuleConfig` carries `SchedulerGateConfig`, so `mode = off` looks
// answerable from here. It is not. The gate is *live* state — the user's toggle,
// AC power, CPU pressure, whether anyone is signed in — and the module holds the
// config it was loaded with. A module that paused itself on a stale `off` would
// stay paused after the user switched background AI back on, with no channel to
// learn otherwise and no way out short of a restart. Guessing is worse than not
// answering.
//
// # So: identical behaviour, no longer silent
//
// Each stub returns exactly what the unwired path returned, so installing them
// changes no scheduling and wedges nothing, and each reports once per process
// the first time anything actually consults it. The queue worker pool now runs
// in here (`crate::start_queue_pool`) and consults both, so the scheduler-gate
// report fires on every boot that drains a job — which is the honest signal that
// the throttle is not in effect.
//
// # The scheduler-gate stub now also silences two user-visible pauses
//
// `crate::start_sync_loops` moved the two periodic sync loops in here as well,
// and they consult this gate for something the queue pool does not: not a
// throttle but a *stop*. Step 0 of every tick in both loops is
// `sync::composio::periodic::periodic_pause_reason`, which exists to honour two
// states — `PauseReason::UserDisabled`, the user switching Memory Tree off in
// Settings, and `PauseReason::SignedOut`, no live session. It reads them off
// `current_policy()`, which is the stub, which always answers `Policy::Normal`.
// So in module mode both loops tick straight through both pauses: a user who
// switched memory off still gets background fetches, and a signed-out user still
// gets a Composio connection walk every 20 minutes.
//
// The per-source `enabled` toggle is unaffected — that is read from the source
// registry inside the tick, not from the gate — so switching off one source
// still works. It is the two *global* pauses that do not.
//
// The same stub's `resume_notify` hands back a `Notify` nobody fires, so the
// other half of that design is gone too: re-enabling sync no longer wakes the
// loops early, and the user waits out the remaining 20-minute tick instead of
// syncing within seconds. That half is benign; the paragraph above is not, and
// closing it needs the same `SchedulerGate` bus interface named below.
//
// The module-local registry this paragraph used to argue against now exists —
// see `ModuleShutdownHost` — and the argument is worth recording because it was
// right about the part that has not changed. Banking hooks and draining them on
// the module's own `Shutdown` method is only useful if something calls it, and
// at the time of writing nothing in the host does on the way out.
//
// What tipped it is that banking is not worse than dropping in the case the
// paragraph worried about, and is better in every other: a dropped hook never
// runs, a banked one runs the moment the host wires the call. The objection was
// really to going quiet, not to banking, so the gap is still announced at
// `install_seams` — now naming the precise condition ("only when the host calls
// Shutdown") instead of a flat "unserved" that a host-side fix would leave
// stale. See tinyhumansai/tinymemory#133 for the host half.
