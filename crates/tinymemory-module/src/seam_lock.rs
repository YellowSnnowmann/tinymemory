//! Serialises the tests that reach `tinymemory_core`'s process-global seams.
//!
//! The seams — event sink, error reporter, NLP host, scheduler gate and
//! shutdown host — are `static`s owned by the process, not by whoever installs
//! them. `libtest` runs a binary's tests on parallel threads, so two tests that
//! each install a seam are racing: one's `set_scheduler_gate` or
//! `set_manual_override` lands between the other's write and its assertion, and
//! the assertion then fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the test
//! that reported it.
//!
//! [`crate::host_test::HostSeamsRestore`] does not solve this on its own, and it
//! is worth saying why, because it looks as though it should. It restores what a
//! test found, which fixes *ordering* — a later test cannot inherit an earlier
//! one's gate. It says nothing about two tests running at the same time.
//!
//! A test that installs or reads a global seam must hold this for its whole
//! body, taken before it captures anything. See issue #130.
//!
//! The lock is `tokio`'s rather than the standard library's for one reason: two
//! of the three callers are `#[tokio::test]` and hold it across `.await`, which
//! is exactly what `clippy::await_holding_lock` exists to stop you doing with a
//! `std` guard. Hence the pair of accessors below — the sync one is not an
//! alternative to the async one, it is for the caller that has no runtime.
