//! Domain types for the summary trees.

//! → month → day → hour (leaf), ported from OpenHuman's
//! `memory_tree/tree_runtime/types.rs`. The second, below
//! [`node_id_to_path`], is the **sealed summary forest**: one tree per ingest

// calendar, levelled by seal generation rather than by calendar unit, and with
// no calendar-shaped node id for `drill_down` to address it by.

// driver with a single structure answers both surfaces from it. What the

// reach only the first has to read the second out of the driver's storage to
// draw it, which is the split-brain this contract exists to end.

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The summariser door, and the roots it eventually produces.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above describes a tree that has already been sealed. The three
// shapes below describe the *act* of sealing one level of it — N contributions
// from level `n` folded into the single node that lands at level `n + 1` — and
// the fourth describes the top of what that folding leaves behind.
//
// # Why the fold has to be a contract member
//
// It is the one step in the tree pipeline that is neither deterministic nor
// local. It costs an inference call, that call is billed, and the provider
// making it is configured on the *driver's* side of the boundary. A host that
// reaches memory only over the module has no chat provider of its own to fold
// with and no rate card to charge against, so the fold has to happen where the
// provider is — and the usage has to come back attached to the text, because
// nothing downstream can recompute it from the words.
//
// That is why [`SummaryOutput`] here carries seven fields rather than the four
// the engine's own deterministic summarisers return: `input_tokens`,
// `output_tokens` and `charged_amount_usd` exist only because a provider was
// paid, and a caller doing cost accounting cannot derive them.
//
// # Every budget crosses, and none of them is defaulted
//
// [`SummaryContext`] carries three separate token numbers and they are not
// interchangeable. `token_budget` clamps the *output*; `input_token_budget` is
// the whole context the fold may occupy; `overhead_reserve_tokens` is the
// prompt and formatting headroom withheld from the sources. The driver divides
// what is left after the other two among the inputs, so a caller that omits
// one and lets it default to zero does not get a slightly different summary —
// it gets every source clamped to nothing and a fold with no evidence in it.
// They are required fields for that reason, not optional ones with a sensible
// fallback: there is no sensible fallback.
//
// [`SummaryContext::ask`] is load-bearing in the same way and in the opposite
// direction: its presence selects an entirely different system prompt. A
// flavoured tree folded without its ask produces a generic digest where the
// caller expected a profile, and nothing in the output says which prompt ran.
//
// # `tree_kind` crosses as a string, not as an enum
//
// The engine's `TreeKind` is `#[non_exhaustive]` and has already grown a fourth
// variant (`flavoured`). A closed enum on the wire would mean the first payload
// naming a kind this build predates fails to *deserialize*, taking the whole
// frame with it — an unfamiliar label degrading into a hard decode failure.
// [`crate::provider::retrieval`] documents that argument at length for
// `RetrievalHit::tree_kind` and `EntityMatch::kind`; this is the same rule
// applied to the same enum, and the hazard is symmetric here because this field
// travels in a *request*: a newer caller naming a newer kind must not make an
// older driver fail to parse the call.
//
// Known values today are `source`, `topic`, `global` and `flavoured`. Unlike
// the response-side fields, though, this one is validated on arrival — a driver
// that cannot map the string onto a kind it understands answers
// [`MemoryError::Invalid`](crate::error::MemoryError::Invalid) naming it,
// because folding under the wrong kind silently mislabels a summary and nothing
// afterwards can tell that it happened.
